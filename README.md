> [!WARNING]
> THIS CODE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND WAS WRITTEN AS PART OF A RESEARCH PROJECT FROM 2003. IT HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED OR TESTED SINCE SO THIS CODE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY SORT.

As part of my exchange with the University of Montreal, I
implemented a visual cryptographic system (supervised by Pierre
Poulin). The project is an identification system using transparent cards
that must be placed on the screen to reveal a secret drawing. It
includes two applications: a key generator (transparent cards to
print) and the login application itself. The [documentation](docs/)
contains more explanations and references are found in the
[project paper](docs/rapport.pdf) (in French).

The main idea of the project is based on the results shown by Douglas
Stinson on his page dedicated to the visual cryptography: http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/visual.html
