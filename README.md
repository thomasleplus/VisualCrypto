# VisualCrypto

As part of my exchange with the University of Montreal, I
implemented a visual cryptographic system (supervised by Pierre
Poulin). The project is an identification system using transparent cards
that must be placed on the screen to reveal a secret drawing. It
includes two applications: a key generator (transparent cards to
print) and the login application itself. The sources are available in
the documentation and explanations and references are found in the
project paper (PS and PDF).

The main idea of the project is based on the results shown by Douglas
Stinson on his page dedicated to the visual cryptography: http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/visual.html
